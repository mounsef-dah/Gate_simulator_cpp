# Gate Simulator in C++

## Description
This project is a simple logic gate simulator written in C++. It allows users to simulate basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and more. The simulator takes inputs and processes them according to the selected logic gate.

## Features
- Supports fundamental logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR  
- User-friendly CLI for input/output  
- Easily extendable to add custom logic gates  
- Written in modern C++  

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g : GCC)  
- Eclipse
